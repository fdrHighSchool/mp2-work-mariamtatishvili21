# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
    takes one input and creates a new string.

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
    takes two inputs to create a new string.

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
    states the position of of a letter in a string.

  * `.equals(str)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
    if input is the same as str. 


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
the i starts at 0, and if the position of i is less than s.length() then it does stuff goes back to the for loop and adds one then repeats to a new position in String s.
